My name is Haley Kell. Let's connect!

I am a computer science student at the University of Oklahoma graduating this December so Iâ€™m currently looking for full time opportunities in software engineering.

Last summer I had an internship at IBM doing backend development for IBM Cloud and this summer I interned at NBCUniversal working on data analytics and product development under Filmed Entertainment. I also have had a research position studying outlier detection in data streams, where I gained experience with parallel programming and performance optimization.

For my job search, I am interested in software engineering, operating systems, distributed systems, embedded systems, and parallel programming.

In my free time, I enjoy spending time with my family, travelling, coding Minecraft plugins, participating in hackathons, and watching Netflix, especially The Office.
